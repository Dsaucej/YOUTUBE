I've been having lessons with CG Guitar for a few months now. I considered myself a proficient player but wanted to progress to a higher standard.

Charlie has tailored the lessons to cover advanced topics such as, playing with odd time signatures, music theory (extended chords, modal theory) and improvisation skills (playing over changes, modal interchange, arpeggio development).

It has been great to solidify my previous/current knowledge and help fill in any gaps as well as getting me to tackle any subjects I'm struggling with.

His supporting resources such as transcriptions are always flawless. Charlie has a great understanding of music and imparting that information to his students.
