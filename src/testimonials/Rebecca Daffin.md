My daughter Erin had come to a bit of a dead end with her guitar and was very close to giving it up, not bothering to practice etc etc.

So following a recommendation she started having Charlie for guitar lessons and what a difference, she now picks up her guitar most days just for fun which is what I wanted her to do I never have to tell her to practice anymore!
