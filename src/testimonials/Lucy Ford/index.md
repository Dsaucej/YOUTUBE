Charlie has been a fantastic teacher to our 7 year old son over the last year. Lessons are always fun and relaxed and they have a great rapport. He is learning songs across many different genres, as well as any current tracks my son requests.

Charlie has the patience of a Saint and we trust him implicitly. I would not hesitate at all in recommending him to anyone looking for a great teacher.
