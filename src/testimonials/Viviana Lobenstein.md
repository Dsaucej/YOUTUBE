Charlie has been teaching Vincent to play the guitar now for over 6 months and he is loving every minute of it. 

He is enjoying practicing at home and discovering lots of new songs that he had never heard before. Growing in confidence and using all the senses! Perfect skill to learn. Charlie makes it fun and challenging. Great personality! Thank you.
