Charlie has been teaching my son (aged seven), for just over 12 months. He always customises the lessons to capture his interest with a wide range of music adjusted to his level of skill. 

This combined with a great balance of patience, talent, enthusiasm and humour has completely inspired him and kept him engaged and motivated. My son sums up the lessons perfectly (below).
