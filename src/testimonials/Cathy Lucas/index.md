Charlie comes along to play to my special needs daughter – he entertains her with her favourite tunes , anything from nursery rhymes, the theme from Postman Pat to her favourite “pop songs”. 

Charlie is calm, patient, always cheerful and most importantly able to improvise - he is never phased by unexpected requests ! His “natural” manner helps to keep the session going well and I am very pleased to be able to recommend him, especially to younger or more nervous pupils.
