Charlie is not only the best teacher I have had but all the way through our time together he was like a friend. He offered me support and was very helpful until the last lesson. I learnt more with Charlie than I have with any other teacher.

In 6 months with him I learnt more the 2 years prior. I would recommend Charlie to anyone, a beginner or an advanced player no matter who you are you will make progress.
