I have only just started to learn the electric guitar with Charlie as my teacher but can fully recommend him to anyone who wants to learn and progress.

I look forward to his lessons every week which then provide me with practice techniques to follow up in the following week. He has a very relaxed and inclusive style which provides a great learning environment. Overall I am delighted to have found him to help me on my guitar playing journey.
