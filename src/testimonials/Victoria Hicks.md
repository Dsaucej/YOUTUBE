Charlie has been teaching my son Joe for 5 years(!), so I can vouch for his stamina, as well as his ambition for his students.

Joe achieved merits in his first 2 rock school grades, and has since chosen to follow Charlie's more 'independent' syllabus in a group lesson which he really enjoys. Charlie is a great teacher, and particularly proactive and organised.
