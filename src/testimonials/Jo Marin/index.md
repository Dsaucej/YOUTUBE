Charlie has been teaching my daughter for about 10 months from complete beginner stage. I’m so impressed by the progress she has made and pleased with her deepening interest in music. Her group lessons are fun and engaging, Charlie is patient and inspiring, and the songs she learns are contemporary or classic rock tunes.

I’ve also been having lessons with Charlie myself after a very long break and he’s been encouraging, very knowledgeable about technique and great to chat to about favourite bands and his own experiences as a professional musician. 

Highly recommended for children and adults!
