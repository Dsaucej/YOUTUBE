Charlie has been teaching my 9 year old son for the last few months and we are so amazed with how much he has learnt in such a short space of time. Charlie is extremely patient and has a great way of explaining things. 

Barnaby has developed hugely in his confidence and he looks forward to his weekly lessons (even practicing without persuasion!) Charlie is a great role model as well as being a fabulous teacher. Highly recommended.
