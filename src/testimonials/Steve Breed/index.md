Charlie has been giving me lessons for 2 or 3 months now and I can wholeheartedly say that he’s really passionate about his craft and has an energy and enthusiasm that’s just great for a student like me. As others have already mentioned, Charlie is very patient and doesn’t tire of answering the questions I have about technique and other minutia which probably sound like daft questions.

Charlie’s a really nice chap and I can’t imagine anyone not getting along with him or his teaching style. A big thumbs up from me!
