Charlie has been teaching me as a beginner for some time. I guess I'm considerably older than probably all his other students - well somebody has to be - but as someone who has been in the teaching profession for most of my life I can only admire his professionalism, his preparation of material for lessons, his incredible good humour and patience and we have a lot of laughs. 

And of course he always knows if I've skimped with the practicing even if he never says anything!!! He is a great teacher and I would not hesitate to recommend him!
