Since he started taking lessons from Charlie, my son's love of the guitar and music, in general, has grown and grown. Charlie's energy and enthusiasm are infectious, and I have been so impressed by my son's progress.

He is working through the Rock School grades and is also learning to play popular songs, both alone and with other students. We feel very lucky to have discovered CG Guitar Tuition.
