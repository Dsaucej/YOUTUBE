My 6 year old son was a complete beginner and Charlie has made lessons interesting and challenging for him. Charlie has been helpful and given me excellent advice whenever I have asked for it.

Charlieâ€™s enthusiasm has rubbed off on my son and he is always keen to practice at home and show Charlie his progress at the next lesson.
