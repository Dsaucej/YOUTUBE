Charlie is an amazing teacher. He is very passionate about music and it really feels like he enjoys doing it. It's been almost a year since I started having guitar lessons with him and, as a foreigner, he has made it extremely easy for me.

He's guided me through the UK education system, as well as giving me the best advice. Having him around is definitely helping in reaching my goals. As a musician, he is very talented. He knows music theory, guitar techniques and different music genres and styles to the detail.

I couldn't think of anyone better if you are looking for expanding your musical horizons. I have no doubt that he has the training and experience to be a great teacher. He is close and easy to talk to, and he is able of helping, guiding and teaching you in the best way possible.
