My son has been having guitar lessons from Charlie, for the past 5-6 years. Charlie has taken him through Grade 1, 2 and 3, and he passed all exams with a Merit. Charlie is professional in his teaching, and my son listens to his advice.

My son has recently changed his guitar, and Charlie was on hand to help and advise us. I would highly recommend Charlie as a guitar teacher.
