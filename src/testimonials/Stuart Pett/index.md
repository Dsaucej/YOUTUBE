Charlie has been teaching my son for about 5 years, taking him from complete novice through to playing some pretty impressive rock songs as well as a couple of music gradings.

Charlie is patient when necessary and tailors his tuition to the tastes, needs and aspirations of his students. Charlie initially taught face-to-face but now lessons are conducted via Skype to surprisingly good effect. I cannot recommend CG Guitar highly enough!
