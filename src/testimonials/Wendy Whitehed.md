Charlie is awesome. He has been teaching my daughter since the beginning of the year and her growth in ability has been huge.

He always has great choices from his song book of contemporary music. He’s very patient and kind, and my daughter has flourished in confidence generally too. I’d recommend him (and already have several times) in an instance.
