Charlie has been teaching my daughter guitar since September and he’s been brilliant. To an otherwise very un-musical family he has been able to teach her not only how to play, but tune and look after the guitar, as well as providing really useful notes for the parents to follow and help with practice.

My daughter loves it because the music is “relevant” and fun for her, (such as the Black Eyes Peas) seems she doesn’t mind the practicing either.
