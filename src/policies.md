## Privacy Policy

Any contact details I acquire from my clients and student records will be stored in a safe location and password protected.

Only I will have access to them and will not share them with anybody else without your consent.
The reason for collecting this data and storing it is so I can keep in touch with you regarding lessons, payment, updates and from time to time marketing purposes.

For example, workshops, new opportunities for my students, and activities alike.

If lessons are permanently terminated and you no longer wish me to keep your details on record then please inform me when doing so.
